SOLID Principles design

SOLID is an acronym representing 5 principles of object-oriented programming that inform the construction of well-designed, maintainable components. These principles apply to functions, classes, microservices, etc.

If you’ve had the experience of recognizing that code is well-written without being able to put your finger on exactly why, it was probably the application of these principles.

The original source of these principles is Robert C. Martin’s paper, Design Principles and Design Patterns (2000).

Martin also wrote a book called Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship that every developer should read; it contains these principles and many more best practices that every developer should have deeply engrained.

Ryan McDermott has a great repo illustrating Clean Code principles (including examples of SOLID) applied to JavaScript.

This is my own cheat sheet, so if you’re already familiar with these principles you might notice that I’ve paraphrased them here, using different wording.
