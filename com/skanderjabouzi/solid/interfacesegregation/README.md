# Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Create specialized, targeted interfaces, isolated by concern.

No component should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

An (adequate) analogy: if you’re designing a motherboard, don’t combine the printer connection with the monitor connection. If I’m designing a monitor, I shouldn’t have to care about printers.
